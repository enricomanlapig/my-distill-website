Hello!  Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. I'm glad you're here.  Please feel free to have a look around.  

Creating this site was one of my sabbatical goals and something I've wanted and needed to do for a long while. I'm grateful for some time to invest in it.  My plan is to use this site as a record of things that I learn, do, and care about, as well as a vehicle for interacting with interested communities.  Since I have broad interests, I suspect it won't be as focused as many other websites. That's okay with me.  I'll do what I can to keep things organized into categories.  Since I'm just starting out, I'm going to try to keep expectations, yours and mine, pretty low.
