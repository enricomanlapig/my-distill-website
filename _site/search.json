Most of the time, I’m a husband, dad, professor, and foodie.\r\nHere are few things about me that you might resonate with.\r\nI went to school\r\nBy training, I’m a microeconomic theorist. I studied economic statistics, operations research, and game theory as an undergraduate. My graduate work was in microeconomics and matching theory. Though the themes of my work as micro, my methods usually involved simulation and networks.\r\nI enjoy problem solving\r\nMy professional career has bounced between management consulting and academia. There are lots of similarities but mostly, both involve problem solving. As a consultant, I worked in defense, financial services, healthcare, and government. In my most recent stint, I worked on some Dodd-Frank stress testing, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (the TTIP), strategic pricing, and plenty of complex derivatives work.\r\nI teach a lot\r\nI teach classes in decision analysis, finance, data analytics, game theory, and microeconomics.\r\nI am food motivated\r\nDon’t tell anyone but I can be bribed with great pizza, sushi, or even a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These activities vary but they usually fall into the following three categories:\r\nDecision support projects: We work directly with community partners to help them frame, model, and analyze high-stakes decisions\r\nDecision training workshops: We train leadership teams to make high quality, value-focused decisions\r\nWriting projects: We reflect upon and write about decision making\r\nOur philosophy of decision making\r\nWe think of high-quality decisions as those that exhibit 6 qualities:\r\na helpful frame\r\nan understanding of the organization’s values and objectives as they relate to the decision at hand\r\ndistinct and viable alternatives\r\nrelevant and reliable information\r\nlogical reasoning\r\na commitment to following-through\r\nA decision can only be as good as the weakest of this qualities are called the Decision Quality Chain. Nonetheless, this notion of decision quality guides everything we do.\r\nWe didn’t invent the Decision Quality Chain or the tools and techniques we use to live it out. Actually, we are students and practitioners of Decision Analysis, a branch of Management Science and Operations Research that draws upon a variety of disciplines including economics, statistics, mathematics, and psychology.\r\nWhat is decision support?\r\nWe support our partner organizations’ decision making with a range of analytical tools and techniques. The tools, models, and analyses we use depend on what the decision maker is facing.\r\nHigh level, strategic decisions are challenging because of they involve complex value trade-offs, significant uncertainty, and/or constraints that make the path ahead unclear. Decision support in this context involves distinct qualitative and quantitative elements. We begin by eliciting and structuring relevant values and objectives, and identifying and modeling key alternatives and uncertainties. With these elements we build decision mathematical models of the decision to formalize and communicate our understanding, generate recommendations, and perform sensitivity and risk analyses.\r\nOur partners sometimes face decisions where the environment is unclear. They may be acutely aware of a problem, but they may not know the cause of it. When the decision maker has data about the environment, we use statistics and data visualization to help them understand the contours of the landscape. When the decision maker doesn’t have data, we can help them identify relevant measures, and design and implement data collection, storage, reporting, and analysis tools.\r\nWho is the Westmont Decision Lab?\r\nThe DLab is directed by Enrico Manlapig, who staffs and oversees projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
